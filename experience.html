					<h3>B.S. in Computer Engineering, graduate in Fall 2018</h3>
					<h4>West Lafayette, Indiana</h4>
					<p>I appreciate the opportunity of being one of the 'Boilermakers' here in Purdue. I seize every chance of improving myself in every way by not only focusing on academic but also joining the co-curricular clubs like IEEE and EPICS. I take part in research opportunity and also contribute my knowledge to freshman and sophomore by being a teaching assistant. I enjoy every moment in Purdue and can't wait to apply the knowledge I gained here to the outside world!</p>

					<h3>Software Engineering Intern, Summer 2017</h3>
					<h4>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>I work in a team of 5 to develop a web-based integrated environment for chip design.</li>
						<li>I create C++ program to automate synthesis process and result in an increase of 40% production speed.</li>
						<li>I implement algorithm to optimize space complexity(30% of space is saved) by recursively arranging blocks in circuit design.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Autonomous Obstacle-avoiding Robot, Spring 2017</h3>
					<h4>West Lafayette, Indiana</h4>
					<p>I co-wrote the software for this robot. I invented the logic and convinced my teammates of the efficiency of my solution in terms of space complexity.
					Space is important in this competition because we are using 9S12C micro-controller which does not have a decent amount of memory space.
					I utilized tool like GDB to efficiently debug the program and I make sure the code is human-readable.</p>
